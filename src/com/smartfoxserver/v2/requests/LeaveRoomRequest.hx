/**
 * Leaves one of the Rooms joined by the current user.
 * 
 *<p>Depending on the Room configuration defined upon its creation(see the<em>RoomSettings.events</em>setting), when the current user leaves it,
 * the following events might be fired:<em>userExitRoom</em>, dispatched to all the users inside the Room(including the current user then)to warn them that a user has gone away;
 *<em>userCountChange</em>, dispatched to all clients which subscribed the Group to which the Room belongs, to update the count of users inside the Room.</p>
 * 
 * @example	The following example makes the user leave the currently joined Room and handles the respective event:
 *<listing version="3.0">
 * 
 * private function someMethod():Void
 * {
 * 	sfs.addEventListener(SFSEvent.USER_EXIT_ROOM, onUserExitRoom);
 * 	
 * 	// Leave the last joined Room
 * 	sfs.send(new LeaveRoomRequest());
 * }
 * 
 * private function onUserExitRoom(evt:SFSEvent):Void
 * {
 * 	var room:Room=evt.params.room;
 * 	var user:User=evt.params.user;
 * 	
 * 	trace("User " + user.name + " just left Room " + room.name);
 * }
 *</listing>
