/**
 * The<em>SFSErrorCodes</em>class provides a mean of translation between server error codes and their relative error messages.
 *<p>Error messages are provided by default in the English language but they can be localized and substituted in any other language.
 * The error messages contain special placeholders that are processed at runtime and substituted with runtime data.
 * They are in the form of a number enclosed in curly brackets such as:{0}, {1}, etc.
 * Please make sure you maintain these placeholders while translating the messages.</p>
